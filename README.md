# R&D Subteam Projects

Welcome to the R&D subteam repository! This repo is dedicated to documenting and managing our ongoing projects aimed at teaching electronics and programming through hands-on experiences.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Embedded Systems: Build an Arduino from the Ground Up
This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of embedded systems by constructing a custom Arduino board. Participants will learn:
- Microcontroller architecture
- Circuit design and PCB layout
- Programming microcontrollers in C/C++
- Interfacing with sensors and actuators

### 2. Game Development: Learn OOP and Software Engineering Paradigms
In this project, participants dive into game development while mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and software engineering principles. Key learning points include:
- Game design and development lifecycle
- Principles of OOP (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Software engineering paradigms and best practices
- Hands-on experience with game engines (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine)

### 3. Problem Solving: Competitive Programming Track
This track aims to enhance problem-solving skills and algorithms knowledge through competitive programming. Focus areas are:
- Mastering C++ programming language
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)
- Participating in coding competitions and challenges

## To get Started
Find in each folder a README a plan broken down into weeks
Each week will contain the following sections:
- **Topic**: The main subject or skill being focused on that week.
- **Problem**: The specific task or challenge to work on.
- **Resources**: Helpful links and materials to assist you with the week's topic.


We’re excited to see what you’ll create and achieve through these projects. Happy learning and coding!
